    <h1> About me</h1>

    <p>
        I am someone who likes to challenge myself which is why I'm very excited about my journey with futureproof. Coding has been a hobby of mine for a while as I admire the versitility it offers. 
        I am interested in both front end and back end and really like the designing components of it, as I like going into small details of the design.

        Hobbies

    <p>
        I have many hobbies outside coding in my free time such as writing, painting, scultpting and creative past times. Thanks to my degree in English and creative writing I feel like 
        creative skills can help me think of uncommon but efficient solutions to problems and also help with design components. I also like gaming which is something in the future I want to 
        move into as part of my tech career.
