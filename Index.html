    <h1> About me</h1>

    <p>
        I am someone who likes to challenge myself which is why I'm very excited about my journey with futureproof. Coding has been a hobby of mine for a while as I admire the versitility it offers. 
        it offers. I am interested in both front end and back end and really like the designing components of it, as I like going into small details of the design.
